# 3D_React project

This project explores the possibilities of integrating interactive 3D interfaces into React-based web applications, utilizing specialized tools and techniques to enhance web applications through the integration of 3D elements, while the primary objective was to explore the capabilities of React as a foundation for developing 3D web applications, with a focus on creating visually engaging and responsive 3D content.



## Technologies

During the project were utilized several prominent 3D libraries and tools such as Three.js, React Three Fiber (R3F), Spline, Babylon.js and p5.js, Ultimately, the project aims to identify the most efficient and scalable solutions for building interactive 3D experiences in React environments. Thus only these technologies were chosen to create the sections described further.

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaSCript
* TypeScript
* React
* Three.js
* React Three Fiber
* Spline
* Vite
* git

## Sections

The webpage of the project is separated into five sections which represent different use-cases for interactive 3D models within a React-based interface.
