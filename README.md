# 3D_React project ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Desktop_only-yellow?style=flat&label=!&color=yellow)



This project explores the possibilities of integrating interactive 3D interfaces into React-based web applications, utilizing specialized tools and techniques to enhance web applications through the integration of 3D elements, while the primary objective was to explore the capabilities of React as a foundation for developing 3D web applications, with a focus on creating visually engaging and responsive 3D content.




## Technologies

During the project were utilized several prominent 3D libraries and tools such as Three.js, React Three Fiber (R3F), Spline, Babylon.js and p5.js, Ultimately, the project aims to identify the most efficient and scalable solutions for building interactive 3D experiences in React environments. Thus only these technologies were chosen to create the sections described further.

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaSCript
* TypeScript
* React
* Three.js
* React Three Fiber
* Spline
* Vite
* git

## Sections

The webpage of the project is separated into five sections which represent different use-cases for interactive 3D models within a React-based interface.

### Introductory section

The introductory section of the application was designed using Spline, emphasizing an
interactive and visually engaging 3D experience through animations responsive to user
interactions.

### Primitives section

The Primitives section presents a structured interface divided into three areas: a menu for
model selection and customization, a 3D model display, and a description area. Together,
these segments provide users with an interactive workspace where they can explore various
3D primitives and modify their attributes and appearance in real-time.

### Shaders section

The Shaders section provides an interactive setup where users can explore and customize
shaders through a dynamic visualisation interface and accompanying shader descriptions.
This section emphasises hands-on experience with real-time shader manipulation.

### Physics section

The physics section of the application was crafted in Spline. A key feature of this section is its interactivity, enabling users to drag, drop, and collide the
boxes in real-time. Spline’s built-in physics capabilities allow boxes to respond naturally touser actions, transitioning and colliding realistically as they are manipulated, thereby transforming the scene into a responsive and tactile experience.

### Custom model upload section

The model upload section was built using the R3F and provides an intuitive interface for
users to import and view their custom 3D models of formats such as FBX, OBJ, GLTF and
GLB or to upload files directly from their computer’s file explorer, making the feature
accessible across various device configurations.
